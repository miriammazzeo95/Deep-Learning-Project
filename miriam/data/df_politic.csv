Alexander on Saturday delivered the Weekly Republican Address with a focus on education, specifically a long-term fix on student loans and a Republican plan for K-12 education that ÛÏputs Washington out of the business of deciding whether local schools are succeeding or failing.Û  In his remarks, Alexander said Senate Republicans ÛÏwill work hard with the President and the HouseÛ on a long-term student loans solution. He also described ÛÏa major disagreementÛ with Democrats on K-12 education, saying, ÛÏTo put it simply, Democrats want a national school board; Republicans favor local control.Û http://1.usa.gov/18RoHWj"
2504,"ICYMI: On the Senate floor yesterday, Sen. Alexander called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate HHS Secretary SebeliusÛªs fundraising and coordinating with private entities to implement the presidentÛªs health care law, saying ÛÏthe analogy with Iran-Contra is strong.Û Follow this link to read more, including the letter Alexander sent yesterday to Sebelius asking for more information on her actions: http://1.usa.gov/12xU552"
2505,"I voted yes on #HR2, American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. The bill combines several pieces of energy-related legislation that previously passed the House. The legislative package seeks to expand U.S. energy production and reduce bureaucratic red tape. It passed 226-191."
2506,"Congressman Ron DeSantis endorses Rep. RaÌ¼l R. Labrador for Republican majority leader:  This week, the House Republican Conference will vote to elect a new Majority Leader for the House of Representatives to fill the position currently held by Eric Cantor. The defeat of a sitting House Majority Leader is unprecedented, and, by my lights, represented a firm rebuke to the Washington, DC establishment. The question is: will House Republicans get the message?  The vote is by secret ballot, but I believe that members should be transparent with their constituents and disclose who they support. I will be voting for Congressman RaÌ¼l Labrador.  RaÌ¼l Labrador is a conservative reformer who will stand for liberty and challenge Washington sacred cows. He is also a skilled communicator who is capable of articulating limited government principles to a broad cross-section of Americans. I am happy to support a change agent like RaÌ¼l for the position of House Majority Leader.  Below is a good take from Hugh Hewitt about what RaÌ¼l would bring to the table as the next House Majority Leader.  http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-California/2014/06/16/Hewitt-Raul-Labrador-as-Majority-Leader-Can-Stun-the-Media-Elites-and-Shake-Up-America"
2507,"I voted yes on the Rohrabacher of CA Amendment 25 to #HR4660, which prohibits funding in the bill from being used by the Department of Justice to prevent certain statesÛÓincluding MichiganÛÓfrom implementing state laws ""that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana."" I am a cosponsor of the amendment. The amendment is nearly identical to Rep. Rohrabacher's amendment from 2012, which I also supported. Here's my previous vote explanation: http://facebook.com/repjustinamash/posts/398285686877510.  Two years ago, the amendment failed 163-262. This year, the amendment was agreed to 219-189."
2508,"I voted yes on ordering the previous question (closing debate) on #HRes575, the rule defining the process for considering #HRes567, which establishes the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi. The motion passed 223-192."
2509,"She has had no problem with U.S. intelligence agencies, like the #NSA, violating the Constitution by spying on hundreds of millions of Americans without probable cause. This kind of hypocrisy is one of the biggest reasons the public can't stand Congress."
2510,"I voted no on the Polis of CO Amendment to the title of #HR3865, which amends the long title of the bill to read: ""To protect anonymous special interests by prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from modifying the standard for determining whether an organization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare for purposes of section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."" The long title of a bill is meant to provide a summary of its purpose or scope. The purpose of this bill is not ""to protect anonymous special interests."" The amendment was not agreed to 177-241."
2511,"I voted yes on H Res 303, the rule defining the process for considering H R 5. The structured rule (only certain amendments allowed) provides for one hour of debate equally divided between the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. All points of order against consideration of the bill or the amendments are waived. Twenty-six amendmentsÛÓincluding seven from Democrats and four bipartisan proposalsÛÓare in order, and one motion to recommit (return the bill to committee) with or without instructions may be offered. It passed 230-190."
2512,We're not going away.
2513,"I voted yes on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H R 634, Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act of 2013. This bill is substantially similar to H R 2682 from the 112th Congress, which I also supported. The only notable difference is this year's inclusion of cooperatives (e.g., farmer-owned cooperatives) as end users. Here's my previous vote explanation: http://facebook.com/repjustinamash/posts/336034966453030. It passed 411-12."
2514,"I voted yes on the Meadows of NC Amendment to H R 2217, which prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from entering into new contracts for ammunition purchases until it submits a report required by the underlying bill on the purchase and use of ammunition by the Department. DHS has reportedly purchased as many as 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition over the last year, with even more purchases planned. The American people and Members of Congress rightfully have questions about these purchases, and it's appropriate to halt new contracts until these questions are answered. It passed 234-192."
2515,I voted no on the Chu of CA Amendment 8 to H R 3. The amendment requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study and prepare a report on the projected cleanup costs of a Keystone XL pipeline spill. Similar studies to the one the amendment requires have already been conducted as part of the Environmental Impact Statement. The amendment failed 185-231.
2516,"I voted no on the motion to adjourn. Motions to adjourn are sometimes made in protest or so Members of Congress can make a point by rejecting them, but I'm told the point of this vote was simply to extend the current session by a few minutes (presumably so leadership can whip us on an upcoming vote). The motion failed 1-415."
2517,"Senator Ayotte released the following statement regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs patient access audit released today, which found that more than 57,000 veterans are currently waiting for appointments at VA facilities across the country.  The report indicated that the VA Medical Center in Manchester and the VA hospital in White River Junction, both of which serve New Hampshire veterans, are not among those flagged for further review and investigation.  ÛÏNo veteran should have to wait more than 90 days for an appointment, and New Hampshire veterans should be given the choice of seeing a private provider so they donÛªt have to wait in line or be forced to travel hours to seek care,Û said Senator Ayotte.  ÛÏThe bipartisan VA reform legislation being crafted in the Senate will help address the systemic, nationwide problems detailed in the audit released today, and IÛªm hopeful the Senate will quickly take up this legislation once itÛªs finalized to make sure veterans can get the timely care they deserve.Û"
2518,"I want to thank my fellow Nevadans for their participation in numerous town halls, individual and group meetings, and facility tours during the past four weeks. Listening to the feedback of the people who hired me has been more productive and helpful than most anything else undertaken in Washington, D.C. this year.

2639,"Seventy years ago today - D-Day - 160,000 Allied troops landed on a stretch of heavily-defended beaches along the coast of France, beginning the invasion of Europe in World War II.  The largest amphibious invasion in history, it was the beginning of a hard fight across the continent and the first crack in Germany's Fortress Europe.

2642,"I was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the House last night to promote and support H.R. 3685, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act.  This legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  An unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  This really took me by surprise ÛÒ the fact that the ACA could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  That would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  Simply put: This is a public safety issue.  IÛªve been concerned that since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  I sent the IRS a letter in November requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  Under the Employer Mandate Provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  This could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in Pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  Fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    Some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ÛÏWell, weÛªve only got 25 volunteers so weÛªre safe.  We donÛªt have fifty.Û That may not necessarily be the case.  Some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  That could mean that if you take the number of firefighters ÛÒ paid and unpaid ÛÒ now considered employees by the IRS, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.Û"

AND to add insult to injury, the president now has the gall to say that he will veto the House passed the legislation delaying Obamacare's employer mandate and individual mandate.

TrinityÛªs new railsÛÓwhich they saved about $2 per head onÛÓoften jammed, causing the rail to pierce vehicles, putting lives in danger.   This is unacceptable, and it took far too long for the US Federal Highway Administration to start asking the right questions.  The more I learn about the supposed watchdog function of these federal agencies, the more concerned I am about how cozy they are with the industry.

2734,"The Government of #Azerbaijan has arrested Ms. #Leyla Yunus, Director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy in Azerbaijan, and her husband, #Arif Yunus, and charged them with high treason, tax evasion and other economic crimes.    The charges filed against the #YunusÛªs are outrageous. Both Leyla and Arif are long-time supporters of people-to-people contact with #Armenia, and the charge of espionage against them is absurd. We urge the Government of Azerbaijan to drop the charges and to stop the coordinated campaign aimed at the opposition, civil society and journalists in Azerbaijan who are peacefully exercising their right to freedom of speech and freedom of association."
2735,"#SCOTUS  got it wrong with #HobbyLobby. That's why I'm supporting the Protect WomenÛªs Health from Corporate Interference Act. The legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #ACAt and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits.   Allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable. The Supreme Court has put the health of American women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law.  Whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer. The Affordable Care Act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services, including contraception.  Imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent.  #NotMyBossBusiness"

The maximum number before was in the three hundreds. When Lisa Jackson was confirmed, there were about 100 questions asked.    This has been a pattern on the Republican side of the aisle with obstructing President ObamaÛªs nominations. Yesterday we saw, in one of our committees, a technical rule used to block the vote for Tom Perez to be Secretary of Labor.  This is a pattern of blocking confirmation votes for President ObamaÛªs nominees for key cabinet positions. This is wrong."

2751,Please share: Wednesday is the eighth annual ÛÏOperation Hire a Hoosier VeteranÛ Job Fair at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. Nearly 200 employers will be in attendance and looking to hire qualified applicants.
2752,This morning I offered an amendment to reform the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full Senate that would extend unemployment benefits. My amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   The amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving EUC benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. States would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     We need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. I have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in Indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. This undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.   We are waiting to see if Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow votes on Republican amendments.

2757,"ICYMI: The Senate passed the VeteranÛªs Access to Care Through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act with my support and an overwhelming bipartisan majority. Among other things, the legislation expands veteransÛª access to care by allowing those faced with lengthy wait times to seek private medical care outside of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system.  When called upon to serve, our nationÛªs veterans bravely did so without hesitation or delay. In return, they should not be forced to wait inordinate amounts of time for quality medical treatment. In addition to establishing more permanent fixes to begin addressing the widespread failures within the agency, this measure is particularly beneficial to rural Idahoans, allowing veterans living more than 40 miles away from a VA facility to seek private health services.

Last night, Senator Jim Risch and I supported the bipartisan Student Loan bill to bring interest rates back down to 3.86 percent from 6.8 percent.  This Student Loan measure will make it less expensive for students to plan for college and it links rates to the financial markets.  I would prefer to return to the private sector handling student loans to reduce government bureaucracy, but action was needed and we were able to reach agreement on a bipartisan solution to help IdahoÛªs young people."

GAO also found that 12 percent of the 131 areas GAO identified in its past two reports were addressed, while 66 percent were partially addressed and nearly 21 percent were not addressed.

2847,"Besides being one of the more beautiful places on God's green earth, Tow, Texas, also played a significant role in the Civil War.  In the days before refrigeration, salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather. The Bluffton-Tow Salt Works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the Confederacy.  During the war, every day the residents of Tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt.  In 1852, David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, were the first settlers in the area. Local Indians showed them salt beds near the Colorado River, which they developed into saltworks.  A year later, John F. Morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area.  They established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally.  William and Wilson Tow also moved to the area in 1853 and  named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley. I am proud of the rich history of the towns and cities in the 11th District.  Men like the Cowans and John Morgan are the type of entrepreneurs that built America and give me faith in our future."
2848,"Less than two months after the Sept. 11th attacks on America, the historian Donald Kagen gave a lecture on the importance of a patriotic education for maintaining and strengthening our country.  Earlier this month he gave an expanded version of that lecture.  In the lecture, he said that for Thomas Jefferson the most important goals of education were civic and moral.   Kagan said, ""This was not meant to be a 'value free' exercise; on the contrary, its purpose was to communicate the special virtues of republican representative democracy, the dangers that threatened it, and the responsibility of its citizens to esteem and protect it. This education was to be a common experience for all citizens, rich and poor, for every one of them had natural rights and powers, and every one had to understand and esteem the institutions, laws and traditions of his country if it was to succeed."""
2849,"The only pecan breeding program in the world is located in Brownwood, Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture site got its start in the 1930s when horticulturist Hamilton P.

This afternoon, I met some of the very talented men in women working at the center.

2850,"I was honored today to give the closing remarks for the West Texas Legislative Summit.  I discussed the Environmental Protection Agency's war against fossil fuels.  I warned those in attendance that the EPA is currently targeting coal, but they have fracking in their sights.  I also discussed the EPA's proposed rule that provides essentially no limit to their jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, despite the Supreme Court consistently recognizing that Congress limited the authority of the EPA under the Clean Water Act.  We have some challenges with water in West Texas. Those are challenges that need to be addressed by the men and women in West Texas and not EPA bureaucrats in Washington, DC.  I have been fighting these anti-energy efforts by the Obama Administration and will continue to do so.  Energy production in West Texas is the engine of our nation's economy and strengthens our national security. The men and women who are involved in the energy industry are creating jobs and making America a safer place."

Part-time, working women often are at a disadvantage compared to their part-time male counterparts. In addition, full-time working women make only 77 cents for every $1 made by their male counterparts. The article linked below explains this well. Democrats in Congress are pushing to address the economic challenges of working families:  Access to quality child care, paid family leave and paycheck fairness are important steps towards ensuring economic stability for women.

The bill is not perfect and neither side is happy with everything in the agreement.  However, in a year filled with far too much partisan fighting, this compromise is an important step forward.  Programs that help create jobs in Pennsylvania such as Community Development Block Grants and NIH medical research will likely face fewer cuts under this deal. In addition, overall deficit reduction will be approximately $20 billion higher under this agreement than without it. Moreover, the bill will allow us avoid another damaging government shutdown.

2901,"Senator Corker has co-authored an amendment with Senator John Hoeven to bolster security on the nationÛªs southern border as part of the immigration bill now being considered by the Senate. The Hoeven-Corker Southern Border Security Amendment would double the number of agents on the Mexican border and require implementation of a tough new border security plan before unlawful immigrants already in the country could be eligible for Lawful Permanent Residence (LPR) or Green Card status 10 years after enactment. The border security plan is based on the U.S. Border PatrolÛªs assessment of what the agency would need to maximally secure the nationÛªs southern border. The amendment also strengthens interior enforcement by requiring that officials enforce current immigration law and deter overstays by initiating removal proceedings for at least 90 percent of visa overstays. Ten years after enactment, the senatorsÛª measure requires all five of the following conditions to be met before LPR, or a Green Card status, could be granted:
 
 - The Department of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Inspector General of the Department, and the Comptroller General of the United States (GAO), has submitted a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy to Congress that includes minimum requirements for each sector along the border as identified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the plan has been deployed and is operational.  
 - The Border Patrol has deployed, maintained, and stationed 20,000 border patrol agents on the southern border in addition to the 18,500 agents already stationed there. This means an agent every 1,000 feet along the southern border.
 - An additional 350 miles of fencing has been completed (in addition to the 350 miles of fencing already on the ground).
 - The mandatory employment verification system has been fully implemented for all employers.
 - The mandated electronic entry/exit system has been fully implemented at all international air and sea ports of entry within the United States where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are currently deployed.

The Postal Service estimates it would save roughly $2 billion a year by moving to five-day delivery for some postal products. ÛÏThis is typical WashingtonÛÓwanting to have our cake and eat it, too.  We all know that we need to allow the Postal Service the flexibility to make necessary reforms and cut costs so it can operate more efficiently and effectively, and yet Congress continues to stand in the way.

I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Hoyer and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we continue to promote good-paying jobs right here in America."

2947,"In a bipartisan vote of 67-32, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to delay sharp increases in #floodinsurance rates for millions of property owners in coastal and flood prone areas. But in order for this relief to reach the people who are hurting, House leadership has to bring the measure up for a vote. I have joined more than 180 members in supporting this delay. Today, IÛªm calling on Speaker Boehner to bring this up for a vote."

Cushing was wounded during the battle of Gettysburg but refused to give up. After being shot, he was told to move to the back for safety. Lt. Cushing said he would ÛÏfight it out, or die in the attemptÛ. His courage and leadership were vital to the success of the Union army and I am pleased he was bestowed this prestigious honor."
2958,"Obama Administration officials today celebrated the news that the U.S. is spending only $500 billion more than it takes in this year. Clearly those in the Administration are out of touch with the views of the American people. As our deficit swells, our debt spills over to the next generation.   ThatÛªs why, during my time in Congress, I have focused on cutting wasteful spending in Washington. It is also why I voted in support of a budget that curbed discretionary spending, and why I co-sponsored the Balance Budget Amendment to relieve our national debt."

3018,"Statement of Congressman Danny K. Davis on Military Intervention in Syria  The apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria is a human tragedy and our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives.  Much remains unknown about these events as of today and the Congress is beginning a debate on the issue.  My constituents are deeply concerned about events in Syria and they are searching for an appropriate response which will end the killing and move quickly toward a political solution to the war in Syria.  However they are overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. military intervention of any kind.  They are concerned about the morality of such action, they are concerned about the legality of such action, they are concerned about the loss of life resulting from such action, they are concerned about the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of such action, they are concerned about such action involving us more deeply in the Civil War in Syria, they are concerned about what follow on conflict such action might trigger, they are concerned about sabotaging a possible agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, they are concerned about the drawing resources and focus from critical immediate problems here at home.  I share all of those concerns and more.  I have been, and remain today, a staunch support of President Obama.  However, my first responsibility as a Member of Congress is to represent the interests and views of my constituents.  Calls, emails, letters and other forms of communication with my office are running 9 to 1 in opposition to any military intervention in Syria at this time.  Therefore, I am strongly leaning toward a NO vote on any military intervention.  I intend to continue to listen closely to President ObamaÛªs statements and to the views of my constituents as this debate proceeds."

3022,"While America pauses to honor our veterans each November 11th, we must never forget that our veterans deserve our commitment and respect every day of the year. I believe the best way to do that is to guarantee a well-run healthcare system, stellar support services, and a promise to never rush our soldiers into harmÛªs way. This picture is from earlier this year when we broke ground on a new VA clinic in Eugene. We also dedicated a new VA home in Lebanon in September. IÛªm proud of these projects.

Members of the press should be allowed to access and photograph these public lands, without a dictate on how they use the footage from bureaucrats in Washington, DC."
3025,"One year ago today, House Republican leadership shut down the government in an attempt to force through their agenda to repeal healthcare reform. It cost our economy $24 billion and 120,000 jobs, halted business loans, disrupted job training for returning veterans, prevented patients from entering NIH clinical trials, and furloughed two-thirds of the staff at the Centers for Disease Control. IÛªm relieved Republican leaders did not repeat such irresponsible behavior this year, and IÛªm now working on a bipartisan project to modernize medical research, but Congress must never do this kind of direct damage to the country."

Since contraception is essential preventive health care, it should not be singled out for special treatment."
3036,"I agree with President ObamaÛªs call for investing in job creation and economic growth. We need to get deficits under control, but weÛªre more likely to do that with investments in our economy than with misguided austerity measures like sequestration and other deep cuts.

3043,"In commemorating this longest day of war on June 6, 1944, we observed a day full of gratitude to those who sacrificed and those who bear witness today to say thank you.  By all historical accounts this was the day that saved the world from tyranny.  It was an overwhelming honor to meet with many veterans, including my friend Jack Port recently featured as one of San Diego's attending heroes.  What was so impressive in meeting these veterans as they have reached or are approaching their nineties, is to acknowledge that many were not even in their twenties on that epoch day.  I will never forget how much I learned and the emotions I felt.  I wish I could have shared it with my Dad who served as a medic throughout the war but like so many of his compatriots moved on with his life and did not speak about his experience.  During his remarks, President Hollande of France quoted President Eisenhower: Americans were not sure what they were fighting for in Europe, but in liberating the concentration camps they knew what they were fighting against."

This living, breathing document stands as a testament to the ideals we all share and have long held as Americans. 
 
 Every bill I introduce here in the House of Representatives must be accompanied by a statement of constitutional authority, reestablishing that the Constitution remains the standard against which every piece of legislation must be compared.

3076,"I have written before about President Obama's apparent failure to read his daily security briefings. I think this comment from him sums up exactly what I mean (throwing Clapper under the bus along the way):  'Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper,' Obama said, 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.'  But in reality, the Administration was warned all along about the rise of ISIS/ISIL.  Defense Intelligence Director, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had warned President Obama and repeated that info to Congress:  From the attached article:  'By February [2014] we had generals basically reading out their memos to Congress,' he added, referring to testimony from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn predicted ISIS 'probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.' The Islamist terror group had already seized Fallujah and Ramadi, he said, had the 'ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.' By the time Flynn spoke on Capitol Hill, Congress had already heard the story at least once before. Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in November 2013 that ISIS had been militarily active all year because of 'a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, poor operational tactics, and popular grievances, which remain unaddressed.' 'It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,' McGurk said."

3078,"I have said for years now that we could bring energy costs down if we pursued more domestic production and American energy independence. It is a matter of supply & demand.  With oil and gas development happening in N. Dakota and Texas (State and private lands btw is where it is happening - and it could boom in Pennsylvania & New York with Marcellus Shale as well as California with Monterey Shale and Alaska with ANWR / NPR), supplies are way up from increased production coupled with a sluggish global economy which has resulted in soft demand.  Throw technological advances in there, too, for a complete picture of the oil and gas boom we are seeing.  I say the boom is happening in spite of Obama Administration policies. I will be criticized by some on here. That is ok. Average Americans know the truth. And the price at the pump can be lower.  Here is a good read on this:"
3079,"No wonder Nancy Pelosi said ÛÏwe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.Û She succeeded in pulling the wool over the eyes of a lot of legislators, but she couldnÛªt do the same with the American people.  They see straight through the lies and ÛÏfog of the controversy.Û This is what is in it, and this is why it must be defunded."
3080,"Today the House passed H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. I voted in favor of it because it restores local control of education by:  Eliminating Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), the No Child Left Behind ÛÏreport cardÛ requirement;  Eliminating federal highly certified teacher requirements;  Eliminating the federal governmentÛªs ability to tell states how to spend their own education money (maintenance of effort);  Keeping federal funding at sequestration levels;  Consolidating 70 funding programs into one single grant program, eliminating taxpayer funded management positions at the Department of Education headquarters; and  Blocking the federal government from mandating ÛÏCommon CoreÛ standards.  Amendments also passed to remove federally mandated teacher evaluation requirements and to make Title I dollars portable for public schools and charter schools, if a state so chooses.  I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my facebook posts asking for feedback on this issue. I read them all, and your feedback helped me make decisions on dozens of amendments and on the overall passage of this bill. I offered an amendment that would have gone even further in removing the federal government from education, but unfortunately it was ruled out of order and was never considered. However, this bill does represent great progress in this area!"

3082,"Today, we held our first in a series of hearings on the Boston marathon bombings, and there were some important initial takeaways. For starters, we cannot be afraid to name our enemy. If the threat is the radicalization of Muslim youth, then we need to be able to say that. It's also clear that information sharing between intelligence agencies and law enforcement is still not where it needs to be. We can't allow political correctness and government bureaucracy endanger our safety. At the same time, national security can't be an excuse to ignore our civil liberties."

3114,"As I did first in December and again last week, I urge our state leaders to strongly consider a permanent or temporary switch to the federal exchange.

3119,"Boko Haram is an Islamic terrorist group operating in Africa.  This group recently kidnapped roughly 250 (mostly Christian) schoolgirls from Chibok, Nigeria.  Boko Haram forced the girls to don Islamic dress and recite verses from the Koran.  They plan to sell the girls as brides to Islamic men.  Boko Haram leader Abubakr ShekauÛªs recent speech provided with stark clarity the motivation of the group.  Shekau said the attack is part of a ÛÏJihad war against Christians and Christianity.  It is a war against western education, democracy and constitutionÛ_ Allah said we should finish them when we get them.Û  In his speech, Shekau cited his Islamic faith in support of abolishing religious freedom, slaughtering Christians and Jews, selling girls into slavery, raping girls as young as 9 years old, and assassinating the President of the United States.  In a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I was stunned to see a State Department official hedge on whether Boko Haram is motivated by a desire to wage Islamic jihad against ÛÏinfidelsÛ such as Christians.

Most days I made it 7,000 steps or more. Some days way over, while others as low as 4,000 but it has made a difference. Hardest part for me was the bed time snacks and of course the ice cream. I can't completely give it up but I can limit the amount. I found alcohol wasn't a problem though occasionally hard during a late dinner with friends. I limited it to 1 or 2 glasses of red wine and then rest of the evening drank water.   I found my weight fluctuated during the challenge. I lost some and gained back some over the past few weeks. Thankfully, overall it was a net loss. I am now going to try and lose 25 more lbs over the year.   Thank you for all the kind notes during the challenge. They really helped keep going on the first lap. Of course I want to thank Mary for inspiring me to do this challenge. Her helpful hints made us all better informed about the consequences of the food we eat. Finally, congratulations to everyone who completed the challenge.

3174,"At a town hall meeting years ago, I was approached by several seniors who told me they could not find a doctor willing to treat them. That is when I first learned about the underpayment of doctors on the Central Coast by Medicare. This problem has lead to a shortage of doctors in our area and even fewer able to treat Medicare patients. Today I am proud to say that after almost 15 years of hard work, the President signed my bill to fix this. We will now once again be able to attract more talented doctors and keep the ones who are already here. This is a big win for everyone, especially seniors!"
3175,"I am proud that 52 years later, Americans are still answering President KennedyÛªs call to serve their country in the name of peace."
3176,"Emotional gathering of Congress today on the Capitol steps, remembering those lost on 9/11 through prayer and a singing of ""God Bless America."" Moments like this remind us that even though we remain divided on certain issues, we are all still united as Americans."

The delegation from Delta Sigma Theta, which identifies itself as ""the single largest African-American women's organization in the country,"" included constituents Dawn Manning and Christina Bennett of West Orange and Robin Jackson of Caldwell, along with Debra Chandler and Darice Toon."
3182,"This bill aims to get ahead of the massive wildfire threat that plagues communities throughout the country by making fire suppression and proactive forest management priorities. Enacting this measure would prohibit the crippling practice of fire borrowing, while responsibly budgeting for wildfire management at levels commensurate with the size of the problem."

3184,"Today, we look back -- remembering the horror, the thousands of American lives the lost, the feeling that the world had changed forever. We ask each other, ""Where were you when the towers fell?""   But we also remember how, as a nation, we came together. We stood with one accord and we spoke with one voice. The world may have changed that day, but America was and is yet one nation, under God, indivisible. God bless the United States of America. #neverforget"

The name ""ISIL"" references their desire to capture a broad area, including land from Israel to Iraq known as the Levant. Wherever it marches, ISIL flies a black banner of death that threatens innocent persons. "

Our country must move away from its dependence on fossil fuels, toward a renewable energy economy, and ethanol is a critical component.

3226,"The sequestration cuts set to take place today are an unfortunate symptom of a greater problem, which is our governmentÛªs failure to act to find bipartisan solutions to the critical issues we face.  We need to address our debt and cut spending, but we need to do it in a responsible way, not with debilitating across the board cuts that will set back our economic progress and cause deep cuts in places where we canÛªt afford it. I am very disappointed that Congressional Leadership has chosen to convene Congress less than half of the working days this year, rather than working out the details of a grand bargain based on shared sacrifice.  ItÛªs clear that Americans are fed up with the partisan gridlock and governing by crisis and so am I.  ItÛªs time for Congress to come together and take action to replace these potentially devastating cuts with a responsible and balanced alternative."

3229,"Today we celebrate the life and legacy of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  His dream was for every individual to have an equal and uninhibited access to the American Dream, which we are still fighting for today."
3230,"Pending ""stand your ground"" legislation in Ohio eliminates a current law requiring retreat before using deadly force.  This provision has the potential to increase gun violence for many people, regardless of race, and also negatively impact Ohioans subjected to racial profiling.  Insensitive and reckless acts of prejudice should not be supported by laws encouraging violence.  That is why I sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting that the Department of Justice collect additional information on the racial disparities of ""stand your ground"" laws in communities across the country  before another unwarranted death occurs."
3231,"Hearts are heavy in Northeast Ohio as we grieve a fallen soldier.   Army Specialist Angel Lopez was a mechanic in Afghanistan who lost his life due to injuries sustained from an attack on his unit.   AngelÛªs family said he was a good person who loved his family. He graduated from John Marshall High School and leaves behind a wife and two young kids.   The government shutdown impeded AngelÛªs wife ability to receive his last paycheck. But fortunately, the House and Senate recently passed H.J.Res. 91, a funding bill to allow the Pentagon to pay military death benefits despite the government shutdown.  Now AngelÛªs family no longer has to worry about costs such as his burial expense.  At least 2,146 members of the U.S. military, 132 this year alone, have died due to the Afghanistan conflict. This 12-year-old war has resulted in far too many casualties and I look forward to the day when all of our troops can be safely brought home.    My thoughts and prayers are with the Lopez family."

3323,"I welcome the news that Eric Holder will step down as Attorney General. From Operation Fast and Furious to his misleading testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the DepartmentÛªs dealings with members of the media and his refusal to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRSÛª targeting of conservative groups, Mr. Holder has consistently played partisan politics with many of the important issues facing the Justice Department.

3332,"What did the White House know about the VA scandal and when did they know it?   Cooking the books is not only dishonorable and disgraceful, it's a crime. If the president really was hands-on, he'd tell the FBI to go in and investigate this crime. The president is always a day late and a dollar short on these things.  If President Obama had it in his gut to really fix this, he would be on the phone -- the first guy, not the last guy -- telling the FBI, 'I want to find out if a crime was committed against our veterans' and he would be offering a solution to make sure this never happened again."

3355,"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released a report, which included the economic impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Many have mischaracterized the report, claiming that the ACA will directly cost the American economy upwards of two million jobs. The report actually states, and CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed yesterday before the House Budget Committee, that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked across the economy by an amount equivalent to about 2 million full-time workers over the next 10 years. These estimates reflect workers, not jobs. The ACA will actually give workers the freedom to work less because they will no longer need to work longer hours or remain trapped in their jobs to hold on to affordable health insurance."

To do that, we need additional funds to follow the law, which says we must keep these kids safe while they are in our care and their individual cases must be processed by immigration courts quickly. We also need to work with the home countries in Central America so these kids can safely grow up in their home countries."

3365,"In light of major recent data breaches such as the one affecting 70 million Target customers, it is more than possible to think the same could happen to an #Obamacare website that is still not ready for primetime.  That's why I supported commonsense legislation in the House today that would require the  Federal government to notify individuals within 48 hours if their personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed through an Obamacare exchange.  The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act passed on a bipartisan 291-122 vote, and will help protect Americans' personal information."

3372,"Americans need fair pay, not another dose of corporate tax breaks: ""Ohio's minimum wage is $7.95 an hour, which works out to just over $16,500 for a year of full-time work, and Ohio has not exactly licked the problem of people working hard but still living in poverty. And if the minimum wage was truly left to the states, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana would have no minimum wage at all."""

The House has acted on behalf of the American people to stop President ObamaÛªs lawless action and preserve our constitutional checks and balances. This is one positive step in what will be a broad effort to shut down the presidentÛªs plan. I am very encouraged by the lawsuit filed yesterday by seventeen states, including Georgia. The incoming Senate Republican Majority will soon work with the House to block executive amnesty. Conservative senators have already promised to use their unique powers, such as the ability to block presidential appointments.

3425,"For the third time in as many weeks, I am extremely pleased to see the Senate pass one of my sponsored bills, this time, honoring one of ArizonaÛªs greatest public servants, Barry Goldwater. My bill would designate the post office located at 442 Miller Valley Road in Prescott, Arizona, as the ÛÏBarry M. Goldwater Post Office"".  Barry Goldwater paved the way for the modern Conservative movement while continuing to fight for the principals passed down to us from the founding fathers including advocating for limited government and protecting individual liberty.

3427,"Today I spoke at a press conference with my colleagues including Congressman Steve Daines and Senator Ted Cruz opposing the creation of an internet sales tax.   As a former small business owner, I know that entrepreneurs face many challenges that threaten their success. An online sales tax punishes retailers for not having a physical presence in all 50 states and is bad for small businesses and bad for growing a 21st century economy. I have a position of no new taxes. Period. I will continue to fight misguided legislation that imposes new taxes and burdens on hard-working American families.

3431,"Today, I voted to delay implementation of Obamacare with the intention that in the next year we will scrap the worst law Congress has passed since Prohibition. This law represents the single largest peace-time tax increase on an already over-taxed American public. Obamacare destroys the relationship patients have with their doctors and puts bureaucrats in the middle. The impact of this law has cost workers their jobs, raised policy premiums and limited health options.  President Obama already admitted that his law was unworkable. Democrats have admitted it is a ÛÏtrain wreckÛ ÛÒ a phrase that insults train wrecks. Employers and labor unions agreed this law is misguided.  As this train wreck plows full steam ahead toward the American people, I will make every effort to save my constituents from this disaster. TodayÛªs vote is a part of that effort."

3470,"Yesterday, speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives, I shared a story that is close to my heart. A few years ago, my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart. Due to her advanced age, the doctors believed that surgery was too risky. A few years later that aneurysm got worse, endangering her life. She was re-evaluated, and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery.  Putting her faith in her doctors, in our healthcare system and in her god, she chose to have the surgery. Fortunately she made a full recovery. However, none of this would have been possible without Medicare. My mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker, and did not have a private pension or any option other than Medicare. As Congressional Republicans look for an easy way out on these issues, it is people like my mother who are left behind. This is a personal issue to me and the millions of American families with similar stories.  Republicans have tried for years to destroy Medicare by turning it in to a voucher program. They would break the promise we made to our nationÛªs seniors, that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age. Medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country, boasting an overhead of only 2%. The problem isnÛªt Medicare; itÛªs the rising cost of healthcare.   One major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other. We must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare. As the Representative of Silicon Valley, I have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine, personal health connected devices, and other tools. I will be reintroducing the Healthcare Innovation and Marketplace Technologies Act later this year to continue this effort. Most importantly, however, I will continue to stand with my friends here in the Congress to protect Medicare and the Medicare guarantee."
3471,"I applaud the PresidentÛªs speech tonight regarding jobs and technology. We must ensure the resilience of the American worker, and the adaptability and innovation inherent in our economy, to keep us at the forefront of global competitiveness.  This is the Silicon Valley way of life and business, where the manufacturing sector employs 1 in 5 workers (more than twice the national average), where breakthrough ideas are cultivated, and where the worldÛªs most successful visionaries and businesses call home.   If we renew our national commitment to winning the manufacturing jobs of the future, bringing Silicon Valley sense to Washington, and employ strategies that play to our nationÛªs natural strengths, we should see a new golden age of American manufacturing."
3472,"The Buffalo Public Schools will receive a $45,000 federal grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The grant money will be used to help with the development of a plan for Buffalo Public Schools to expand the use of food from local farmers to be served in school cafeterias.  The Farm to School Program is a great way to teach students about nutrition while supporting the local economy."
3473,Today I was honored to recognize U.S. Army veteran Sergeant Benjamin Benally with the Purple Heart medal for injuries sustained while serving in Afghanistan. We are thankful for his brave service and sacrifices for our nation.  
3474,Today I led over 30 Members of the House of Representatives objecting to further funding cuts to the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) program and calling on the Department of Homeland Security to restore funding to all cities previously eligible for the program.

3537,"Today's jobs report is no cause for celebration. The reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because Americans are leaving the workforce.  In fact, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years! We need to focus on creating an environment where innovation, small business, and entrepreneurship can thrive.    That means removing roadblocks to job creation like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank and  making America more energy independent.  At the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people ""left behind"" by the government's calculation.   Read more from The Associated Press:  The drop in the unemployment rate in August to a 4å_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate ÛÓ the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one ÛÓ to 63.2 percent. It's the lowest participation rate since August 1978.  Once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. That's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-fewer-working-age-americans-are-working"

The days of high-ranking federal officials at the IRS and elsewhere getting away with betraying the public's trust and then being put on paid, taxpayer-funded vacations must be brought to a permanent end.

3793,"It was an inspiring day with constituents and caseworkers from the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, House of Hope CDC and Amos House. I met with more than two dozen Rhode Islanders who are homeless or who have faced homelessness in the past. It takes tremendous courage to share such stories of struggle, and todayÛªs group was certainly brave. They were honest and open, and their experiences reinforce the importance of affordable housing in our communities. Over the past decade, low-income families have experienced a 20 percent increase in spending on housing at the same time their incomes decreased by four percent. For too many families, that is not only unaffordable ÛÒ it is unsustainable. I look forward to continuing my work with these partners to increase access to affordable housing and to get Rhode Islanders who are struggling back on their feet."

The role of small business in the Rhode Island economy cannot be overstated. I am encouraged by the vision of state leaders who seek to reduce regulation and streamline the process of starting or expanding a business here, and in Congress, I will continue to fight for strong workforce development programs and career counseling in our schools, in order to close the skills gap. I believe that these efforts will result in a highly-skilled workforce ready to tackle careers in industries with high growth potential ÛÒ especially when it comes to small business."

I read the bill and saw that this was not true. That was one of the reasons I opposed the bailout. Now we see that despite earlier promises, the Treasury Department was readily approving big pay raises while middle class Americans were losing jobs and seeing wages drop. Once again, the middle class pays for the irresponsible behavior of others.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/treasury-approved-big-pay-raises-at-bailed-out-aig-ally-and-gm-report-says/2013/01/28/1e0fe84c-695f-11e2-ada3-d86a4806d5ee_story.html"

3816,"I will be supporting the VA Reform Legislation from the Joint House-Senate VA Reform Committee, where I was a member and a chief negotiator.   Nothing is more important than providing our veterans with the care and respect that they have earned. It was a privilege to serve as a chief negotiator on the VA Reform Conference Committee. I am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan solution. These reforms expand the private sector care options available to our veterans, ensuring that wait times are lower, and convenience is increased.  However, this alone will not fix the cultural problems that plague the department so as to guarantee quality care for our veterans in the long run.  That's why I worked hard to ensure that the bill included measures that will hold bureaucrats accountable for failing to put our veterans first.   These are important steps in the process of rebuilding the trust that has been broken between our brave veterans and the VA that should serve them. The corrupt culture at the VA won't be purged overnight and there is still a lot of work to do.  I will continue to work with local veterans on individual cases and on the Veterans Affairs Committee to address systemic problems that remain.  http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20140728/CRPT-113hrpt-HR3230-Joint.pdf"

3886,"As part of the Black April commemorations, I attended the unveiling of the Wall of Remembrance and the hanging of the U.S. and Vietnamese Freedom and Heritage Flags in Little Saigon.
 
 Black April commemorates the Fall of Saigon in April 1975. The ""Wall of RemembranceÛ serves as a reminder to all of us of the heavy price that both Vietnamese and Americans, along with our allies, have paid in the name of freedom. It also highlights the traumatic experience and the resiliency of the Vietnamese people for justice and liberty, as well as the ongoing struggle of Vietnamese communities around the world for freedom and human rights in Vietnam.
 
 The ÛÏWall of RemembranceÛ is a public display of images and photographs showing the atrocities committed by the Communist government of Vietnam, the refugee experience of Boat People, the retaliation and ÛÏre-educationÛ camps after the war, and the ongoing struggle and activities of Vietnamese community overseas.
 
 It is great to see the Vietnamese Freedom and Heritage Flag, a symbol of freedom flying again in Vietnamese communities throughout the world."

3896,"ONCE UPON A TIME, the GOP changed a House Rule to guarantee a government shutdown, (http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/the-house-gop-s-little-rule-change-that-guaranteed-a-shutdown), fulfilling a plan months in the making.(http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?pagewanted=all)  This plan was the culmination of some 40+ votes to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act, which GOP members and leadership continually stuck to as their reason for not budging during the first days of the shutdown(http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-10-04/politics/42692181_1_funds-government-operations-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling), despite the fact the healthcare exchanges went into effect October 1st anyway.  That is, that WAS the argument, until it was clear they weren't getting anywhere, and instead, the GOP argument started to center on the debt ceiling.(http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/republicans-gop-obamacare-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-98102.html).  Meanwhile, on the ""left"" side of the Chamber,  Democratic members continually tried to bring to the floor a vote on a ""clean"" budget as a compromise to reopen government. This budget - at/below GOP-proposed levels passed by the Senate earlier this year, had the professed bipartisan support of a majority of the House, ((http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/06/majority-of-house-appears-to-support-clean-cr/) but GOP leadership refused to bring it to the floor, and maneuvered to block any member who tried raising it.   Then, the GOP agreed to raise the debt ceiling, but not open the government, as their ""compromise,""(http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+(RSS%3A+Politics))....but only if it was a 6 week debt ceiling agreement...and only if was tied to conversations about how to fix our long term deficit...and only if those conversations were about cuts, and not revenues.(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-greenstein/while-government-remains_b_4066052.html)   And then, they called that tactic moving ""halfway."" (http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/10/boehner_we_re_meeting_halfway_on_what_obama_wants.html).  What's next? Who knows what the GOP will do.  But make no mistake: People across this country- children(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/government-shutdown-wic_n_4073146.html), military families(http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57606695/government-shutdown-hitting-veterans-military-families-hard/), seniors(http://abc10up.com/govt-shutdown-stops-food-delivery-seniors/), and many more are being hurt by this shutdown....with more to be impacted the longer this goes on.

As the son of Cuban-American immigrants, I know what's at stake for these workers, families and individuals who want to take the oath of allegiance to our great nation and become citizens. Providing an earned pathway to citizenship is also important for our national and economic security. And as a member of the Gang of 8, I can say we have had tough negotiations, but the progress towards bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform is real. We're almost there and God willing the bipartisan framework we put forward will pass both chambers with strong support and land on the President's desk and be signed into law this year.

Veterans who have served our nation with duty and honor deserve access to quality health care when they need it. Because Kansas is a rural state, many of our veterans are already forced to travel long distances to visit a VA hospital. Now, Topeka veterans are losing access to the emergency care services they could need at any moment. This is outrageous. It is far past time for Secretary Shinseki and the VA to do their job. I have asked time and again about their failure to address the tremendous shortage of VA physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. It is causing a new VA backlog ÛÒ a backlog of our nationÛªs heroes who are not receiving the health care they need.

3933,"The Ebola virus is a serious international threat to public health that must be contained and extinguished in West Africa.  This requires a global response, including the on-going commitment by U.S. civilian and military personnel. For this crucial humanitarian relief mission, it is no surprise that the Pentagon is calling on MinnesotaÛªs Red Bulls with their proven record of expertise, skill, and resourcefulness.  While they will not be treating patients, their mission is vital to containing this virus in Africa and ultimately saving lives.   As with any mission, the health and safety of our soldiers are my highest priorities. I have been working with the U.S. Department of Defense for months to ensure that U.S. troops are trained and ready to assist in this important work, and that extra steps are being taken to protect their health, including providing personal protective equipment and training about the disease.  I will also work to ensure our soldiers receive the compensation and benefits they deserve during this deployment.  The citizen-soldiers of the Red Bull 34th Infantry Division Headquarters are leaders of the highest caliber, having been called on combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Bosnia. With this deployment to Liberia, our Minnesota Red Bulls will once again have the support and gratitude of the American people.  I wish our troops much success in this important humanitarian mission and their families have my full support."

Our service members voluntarily defend our nation and rely on the support of these benefits for professional and personal growth."
3938,"Today I voted NO along with every House Democrat, on the GOP-Ryan Budget, which is a disastrous for our economy, our families, and the future of our country. Imagine this:  if the GOP budget actually became law, it would result in 2 million lost jobs in 2014 alone (according to the Economic Policy Institute).   Instead of common sense investments, such as growing the economy, creating jobs, and strengthening our families, this Republican budget is harmful.  It lowers taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while 66% of the non-defense budget cuts come from programs helping low or moderate income families.  The GOP cuts and guts $3.7 trillion over the next decade from programs like Pell Grants for college students, job training for dislocated workers, nutrition programs for poor children, and healthcare for our most vulnerable citizens.   Congress needs to move forward with a balanced approach to address deficit reduction ÛÒ increased revenues, elimination of special interest tax breaks, smart cuts to failing programs, and investments in growing the economy."

3958,What a win-win for Alaska! College campuses all over Alaska from Barrow to the Aleutians will receive $23.8 million in biomedical research funding to advance education of minority students to save lives and improve health care in rural Alaska.   ItÛªs a positive advancement to keep promising students in Alaska while also empowering them to carve out an important career path.
3959,This week marks 6 years since TransCanada applied for a permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline to create thousands of jobs and boost AmericaÛªs energy industry.

3963,The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act the Senate passed today is so important for the future of young people across the nation.  It will improve how states and tribes use federal block grants to assist low-income parents who are working or going to school.  I made sure the included maximum benefits for Alaskan kids.  Find out how here: 
3964,"People outside Alaska sometimes ask me: Why do I continue the fight for a life-saving gravel road for the people of King Cove?  To build awareness and momentum, to bring about a change of mind and policy to get this road built.  A big part of that is through stories like this to tell Alaska's story to the nation."

3966,"We Alaskans know our seafood is the best in the world, so why would the U.S. government allow a foreign non-governmental group to tell us itÛªs not sustainable when itÛªs globally known to be so?  My new bill would bar any US federal agency from requiring or endorsing the use of any third party non-governmental organizationÛªs criteria to certify fish or seafood as sustainable.  I believe itÛªs the right policy to ensure that hard working fishermen and the coastal communities that depend on them are not disadvantaged by the agenda of a few misguided NGOs."

Hydro already supplies about a quarter of AlaskaÛªs electricity needs and our state has identified more than 200 promising sites for new hydropower development.  ThereÛªs great potential for more hydropower in Alaska and across the entire country, which is why IÛªm working a bipartisan plan to help make it happen:"
3970,"The Department of Energy claims itÛªs committed to Û÷all of the aboveÛª energy possibilities, but they are cutting innovative and unconventional fossil energy programs that could really help our economy and energy security. Alaskans want to see a commitment across the board on making the most of all the resources we have, from hydro to geothermal to gas and oil, and I asked the Department of Energy today why they are undercutting these critical efforts for jobs and energy security into the future."
3971,"65 days after the PresidentÛªs budget was due and over 2 weeks since the Senate voted on its budget, President Obama submitted his 10-year budget plan today ÛÒ and it adds $170 billion in 2014 alone to our already unsustainable path.  I appreciate him acknowledging that Medicare and Social Security need to be looked at, but his suggestions are tweaks where we need to consider long-term reforms so our children and grandchildren can benefit from these programs.  His ten year plan pushed the real cuts until after heÛªs no longer President, literally passing the buck ÛÒ trillions of bucks ÛÒ to the next person in the White House."

3975,I think the FDA was trying to slip one by us when it released its report and opened up public comment on Frankenfish just before Christmas and during a Congressional transition.

Only 88,000 jobs were added last month, according to the Department of Labor, and nearly half a million people left the job market, bringing down the percentage of Americans in the labor force to its lowest level since 1979. This helped tick down the official unemployment rate to 7.6 percent, but for all the wrong reasons: for every job gained last month, more than five people stopped looking for work altogether. This is unacceptable. America needs real jobs, real solutions, and real results."

They've successfully demanded that other companies, such as Starbucks, Chipotle, and Target, do the right thing and prevent open carry in their stores.

McKinley.  ÛÏSpending is lower than when President Obama took office so weÛªre making progress, but thereÛªs still a lot more to be done.Û  ÛÏAdopting a budget for the first time since the President took office puts spending priorities back in the control of Congress rather than at the discretion of the President,Û added McKinley. ÛÏCongress can now focus on rooting out government waste and abuse and meet our priority of cutting the deficit.Û  Some of the Highlights of the Funding Bill Benefitting the First District:  Û¢No new funding for Obamacare (Affordable Care Act); reduces ÛÏslush fundsÛ by $1 billion; and cuts $10 billion in funding for the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) created by Obamacare. Û¢Provides an additional $132 million for fossil fuel research and development at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown. Û¢Reduces EPA funding by $2.1 billion by scaling back regulatory overreach while enhancing oversight on climate change programs and the mining permit process. Û¢Includes a military retiree pension ÛÏfixÛ to ensure disabled veterans and surviving families receive the full benefits they are due. Û¢Increases funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) by $12 million. Û¢Provides over $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). Û¢Prevents the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. from prohibiting funding for international coal plant projects.  ÛÏAfter voting against the budget proposal in December, the Committee listened to our objections and reworked this bill making it more acceptable,Û said McKinley.  ÛÏNow it provides needed funds for areas like the First District and makes targeted cuts to broken programs.

 This is the first time the Jamboree has been held in the Mountain State, and the event brought nearly 50,000 Scouts, leaders, volunteers and others to the new site.  The first Boy Scout Jamboree took place in 1937 in Washington, D.C.
 
 ÛÏAs an Eagle Scout, I could not be more proud that my home state of West Virginia is hosting the Jamboree and will serve as the permanent home for the event in the coming years,Û said Rep. McKinley.  ÛÏThis week, thousands of Scouts from around the United States, their leaders and others have travelled to the new facility near the New River Gorge to celebrate Scouting and participate in activities to build leadership and character.Û
 
 The site, known as the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, will house Scouts, staff and adult leaders, who will enjoy the outdoors and test their abilities in a number of ways.  
 
 Rep. McKinleyÛªs office also helped in sending 90-year-old Carlyle Farnsworth, a Wheeling resident, to this yearÛªs Jamboree.  Farnsworth is also an Eagle Scout and attended the first jamboree back in 1937.

In this vein, I feel this legislation is a reasonable and necessary step that will help bring positive change to the Agency.Û   Representative Sanford was joined in introducing H.R. 3436 by the following original co-sponsors (listed in order of co-sponsorship):   1.

4124,"Yesterday I introduced legislation to jumpstart the economy, grow the middle class, and fight income inequality. Read the press release below to find out more:  (WASHINGTON, DC / January 27, 2014): Congressman Richard E. Neal, Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Subcommittee, last week introduced legislation to jumpstart the sluggish economy, finance critical infrastructure investments, fight income inequality and create jobs.  The Invest in US Act, extends and reauthorizes key bond measures beneficial for our states and municipalities, extends several critical tax credit initiatives, sets up an infrastructure bank, increases the minimum wage and provides small businesses with tax relief.  ""Right now the U.S. economy is stuck in a rut, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the growing income inequality in America threatens to derail our economy altogether,""  Neal said.  ""In December 2013, we saw the economy only add 74,000 jobs, our lowest since 2011.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 2013 the economy averaged adding 183,000 jobs a month.  At this current rate, the Federal Reserve says the unemployment rate will remain above 6.5 percent until 2015.  This is simply unacceptable, and America can do better, and we must.   The recession has wiped out 8 million jobs, and it is imperative that we get them back.  That is why I introduced the Invest in US Act.  This legislation will go a long way in creating an environment where our economy can take off by making the strategic investment needed to spur growth.  Furthermore, the legislation takes full aim at the growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage, while also providing tax relief for businesses that hire new employees and buy new equipment."" Below please find a summary of the legislation.  The Invest in US Act at a glance: Tax Provisions Û¢ New Markets Tax Credit ÛÒExtends and expands the New Markets Tax Credit program.  The New Markets Tax Credit program is made permanent, with an allocation amount of $5 billion annually.  By permanently extending the NMTC, the legislation ensures that communities will continue to receive investments they need to renew, rebuild and refurbish neighborhoods for generations to come. Û¢ Build America Bonds (BABs) ÛÒ Makes the BABs program permanent, starting with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2013, and phasing down to a 28 percent subsidy rate in 2017 and thereafter.  BABs unleash job creation, economic growth and spur private-sector investments in infrastructure.  From the inception of the program in April 2009 to when it expired at the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate BABs issues, which supported more than $181 billion of financing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as schools, bridges and hospitals. Û¢ Research and Development Tax Credit. Makes permanent and expands the R&D Tax Credit.  The legislation also increases the the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) from 14 to 17 percent. Û¢ AMT repeal on Private Activity Bonds ÛÒ Eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on private activity bonds (PABs).  PABs are a form of municipal bonds that are used by a variety of public and non-profit entities such as airports, seaports and student loan issuers.  The AMT penalty attached to these bonds results in higher interest rates which correlate to higher infrastructure project costs and higher student loan rate burdens. Û¢ Facility Water & Sewer Bonds ÛÒ Exempts water and sewer projects from the private activity bond (PAB) cap.  Currently, the tax code limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond debt that can be issued annually in a state.  The legislation excludes the PABs issued by water and sewage facilities from the state volume cap.  Removing the volume cap makes additional private investment capital available for these types of infrastructure facilities. Û¢ Work Opportunity Tax Credit. - Makes the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) permanent.  The tax credit expired at the end of 2013.  The WOTC provides a federal tax credit up to $9,600 for businesses that hire targeted individuals.  Since 1996, the WOTC has expired numerous times.  Making the credit permanent will end the uncertainty surrounding the credit for employers and potential hires. Û¢ Jobs Training Tax Credit.  The legislation incorporates Senator Menendez's common sense proposal that links community colleges with local businesses to train employees.  Like Senator Menendez's proposal, this bill provides $1 billion in funding for a competitive tax-credit initiative that encourages colleges and businesses to form job-training partnerships.  The proposal also would provide a community college tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to any U.S. based business that trains a long-term unemployed person for an open job that requires a certain type of certificate or other training credential. Û¢ Extends Increased Business Expensing.  This provision permanently extends the 2013 section 179 expensing and investment limitations of $500,000 and $2 million.  This provision is effective for qualifying property placed in service after December 31, 2013. Û¢ Permanent of the 15-Year Depreciation Schedule. Makes permanent the 15-year depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements, restaurant improvements and new construction, and retail improvements.  Currently this is a temporary provision that must be extended annually.  By making this provision permanent we are providing businesses with the certainty they need to undertake capital expenditures, which fuel economic activity and create jobs.  Other Provisions Û¢ Infrastructure Bank.  In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United State's infrastructure a grade of D+ and estimated that the US will need to invest an additional $1.6 trillion to fix our infrastructure.  The Invest in US Act creates the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA), which is an independent, wholly-owned government infrastructure bank, to assist in funding some of the critical infrastructure needs.  Under the proposal, Department of Treasury will make available $10 billion in seed money to encourage private investment in public works projects.  It is estimated that this self- sustaining entity could be capable of leveraging as much as $625 billion in private investment by issuing direct loans, loan guarantees, bonds and debt securities.  To keep both the costs and risks low, the AIFA is also barred from financing more than 50 percent of any one project. Increase in Minimum Wage.  The legislation increases the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25.  This increase is phased in over four years and in three increments of 95 cents.  Thereafter, the minimum wage will increase as the cost of living increases."

 Fort Bliss officials are working closely with the U.S. Air Force Safety Center, the Army Environmental Command and other appropriate agencies to determine the nature and specific extent of the contamination. In the meantime, the area has been closed off to all personnel. Additional environmental and medical evaluations are expected in about a week. 
 
 The affected bunker and other nearby bunkers were once used to assemble nuclear bomb sections. They are currently used to store equipment for National Guard units that are preparing for deployment.
 
 I have been in contact with Major General MacFarland and I am working with him and Fort Bliss leadership to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect, inform, and help anyone who might have been affected.
 
 For the latest information, please visit the El Paso Times website: http://bit.ly/17ioFSU. 
 
 Fort Bliss has set up a number of hotlines for people to learn more about the situation. Please call (915) 744-1255, (915) 744-1962, (915) 744-8263 or (915) 744-8264 for more information."
4170,"Today, the House is debating the National Defense Authorization Act. I took to the floor to speak in support of an amendment that would bring our troops home from Afghanistan.  This amendment would ensure that the President sticks to his timetable to end U.S. combat operations and transfer operations to the Government of Afghanistan by the end of this year.  Since the start of the Afghanistan War, more than 41 soldiers at Fort Bliss have lost their lives; countless others are returning to our community with unseen mental injuries and PTSD. These terrible losses should focus us on our solemn responsibility to know when to bring our soldiers home to their families.   Our soldiers and their families have sacrificed mightily for our nation during the twelve years we have been at war. Thanks to their service, Osama bin Laden is dead, the Taliban and Al Queda have been weakened and the Afghan people have been given the opportunity, should they choose to take it, to form a stable and democratic state. Now is the right time to bring them home to their families."

4174,"Today, the Senate introduced a plan for comprehensive immigration reform.   The plan is a tremendous step toward fixing our broken immigration system and strengthening El Paso.  For the first time in over three decades, Congress has the opportunity to pass a serious comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has the support of a broad coalition of leaders, including members of both parties and business, labor, and immigration advocacy groups. It goes a long way in addressing critical concerns- it creates a path to citizenship for immigrants that pay their taxes, obey our laws and learn English. It also helps reunite broken families, gives young DREAMers an opportunity to pursue their goals and directs resources towards securing our border.  El Paso will be uniquely impacted by whatever bill Congress passes and I am committed to making sure our voice is heard in this debate. Our community has long dealt with the consequences of both long wait times at our ports and immigration laws that break up families and ignore economic conditions. I look forward to reviewing the entire bill more in depth, but it is a great first step to fixing our immigration system. I hope that Congress rises to the challenge and passes comprehensive immigration reform this year.  For a full copy of my statement, click on the link below."

This is simply one of the necessary next steps as we work toward substantial institutional reforms within this troubled agency. The bill passed in the House by a vote of 426-0.

4405,"In my latest installment of Ask Peter, I respond to an e-mail from Karen Werle in Algonquin who asked about #Obamacare architect Jonathan GruberÛªs comments that passing Obamacare relied on the ÛÏstupidity of the American voterÛ and a ÛÏlack of transparency.Û The American people are not fooled. This law was crafted behind closed doors and rammed through Congress on a partisan voteÛÓand the results have been disastrous. As a result, millions have been kicked off their healthcare plans or have seen their premiums skyrocket, while businesses have been forced to cut-back their workforces. ThatÛªs why I introduced legislation to create an independent watchdog to monitor Obamacare, which would help bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the PresidentÛªs healthcare law. #GruberGate"

Each time I visit the hospital I am impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the quality of care they provide, and I am glad to see their efforts recognized nationally.  You can read my press release congratulating Mountain Home by visiting my website."
4413,"Today, I asked the non-partisan Congressional Research Service,  CongressÛªs research arm, to investigate President Obama's authority to delay the employer mandate required by the Affordable Care Act.  The AdministrationÛªs delay is a formal admission that this law canÛªt be fixed. Delaying the employer mandateÛÓwhile preserving the requirement that individuals purchase insuranceÛÓonly postpones the inevitable catastrophe that is Obamacare.  This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama Administration can simply ignore the law when itÛªs convenient for them. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, I am going to get to the bottom of this question."

To all those who lost their lives on that fateful day in New York, at the Pentagon, and on Flight 93, your loss is etched on our memories and our hearts. To the bold and tireless first responders who gave all on that day, and in the days that followed, know that your passing left a shining example of courage and sacrifice in the face of terror and darkness.  As we again face looming dangers on the horizon, the example set on September 11th by our fellow Americans is one we should look to again: American strength, sacrifice, endurance and compassion stood strong the face of evil.  It should be a reminder that we are a resilient nation, and those who seek to rule by repression, fear, violence, and extremism will never overcome the exceptional character and will of the American people."

We transport our heroes to Washington, D.C. to visit and reflect at their memorials. Top priority is given to the senior veterans ÛÒ World War II survivors, along with those other veterans who may be terminally ill.  Of all of the wars in recent memory, it was World War II that truly threatened our very existence as a nationÛÓand as a culturally diverse, free society. Now, with over 800 World War II veterans dying each day, our time to express our thanks to these brave men and women is running out.  Scott's dad, Ike, is an Iwo Jima Marine and took an Honor Flight recently to visit the WWII Memorial with some of his fellow veterans."

4440,"More debt w/ zero spending reforms? Unacceptable.  I strongly believe we must act to avoid defaulting on our debt payments and reopen the government. But I cannot support a plan that increases our nationÛªs debt by half a TRILLION dollars while offering no spending reforms. WashingtonÛªs addiction to spending is what led to this mess, and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach.  A better way forward would be honest, simple legislation that (1) takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms, (2) provides temporary government funding, and (3) allows us time to work toward a real budget. I know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would ultimately support such a plan. The problem is the Û÷shutdown strategyÛª damaged the HouseÛªs bargaining power in these negotiations.  I hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular Americans: striving to protect Americans from ObamaCareÛªs harmful mandates and taxes, setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit, and pushing a pro-growth agenda that will help create jobs for people in Alabama and throughout the country. http://www.wsfa.com/story/23711725/rep-roby-to-vote-no-on"

4443,"Did you see todayÛªs Wall Street Journal article about the number of people on food stamps growing?  With unemployment slowly decreasing and the economy getting slightly better, wouldnÛªt it make sense that the number of people depending on food stamps would also improve?

I look forward to a thoughtful debate later this year regarding ways to eliminate fraud and abuse within the food stamp program to ensure the system actually works for those who need it.

Unfortunately, as the HHS data notes, we can only see numbers for counties with more than 50 UACs. With such numbers (or lack thereof), how are we tracking their safety?  Rather than discouraging the dangerous journey to our southern border, the PresidentÛªs policies have continued the allusion that our country will accept everyone with open arms. It is clear that this Administration has no interest in securing our border or deterring additional vulnerable children from making the hazardous journey to our country.

4500,Today I introduced a great bill to combat waste and allow communities with unused Community Development Block Grant funds to return the surplus to pay down the national debt.  This is a fiscally responsible proposal that would encourage local governments to end the use-it-or-lose-it approach to federal grant money and ultimately work to reduce our out-of-control debt.
4501,"This morning, we heard President Obama emphatically state that Û÷the world set a red-lineÛª regarding the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-AssadÛªs regime. Given his statement, I felt it was appropriate to ask Secretary Kerry during his testimony if the world would join the United States in responding with multi-lateral military force. Unfortunately, Secretary KerryÛªs response was unconvincing and led me to believe that the United States would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations.   During todayÛªs hearing, the Obama Administration had an opportunity to make their case for military intervention in SyriaÛªs long-standing civil war. After listening to todayÛªs testimony, I am, at this time, opposed to the use of U.S. military force because the Administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in Syria pose a clear threat to America, failed to list a strong coalition of nations willing to support military attacks, and failed to articulate a clear definition of victory. While the use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated by any nation or regime, the Administration has not clearly answered these important questions, and therefore, has yet to convince the American people that military action is necessary at this time."

4530,"As we await the President's speech tonight with regard to executive amnesty, I thought it would be useful to read a bit of what he has said in the past on the subject. Toward that end, the Speaker's office circulated the list below, and I thought you might find it of interest:  ÛÏI take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that weÛªre facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And thatÛªs what I intend to reverse when IÛªm President of the United States of America.Û (3/31/08)  ÛÏWeÛªve got a government designed by the Founders so that thereÛªd be checks and balances. You donÛªt want a president whoÛªs too powerful or a Congress thatÛªs too powerful or a court thatÛªs too powerful. EverybodyÛªs got their own role. CongressÛªs job is to pass legislation. The president can veto it or he can sign it. Û_ I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress.Û (5/19/08)  ÛÏComprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. Û_ Anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.Û (5/5/10)  ÛÏ[T]here are those in the immigrantsÛª rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. And it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally. Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship.  And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.Û (7/1/10)  ÛÏI do have an obligation to make sure that I am following some of the rules. I can't simply ignore laws that are out there. I've got to work to make sure that they are changed.Û (10/14/10)  ÛÏI am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've got to have some partners to do it. Û_ The main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. Û_ [T]he most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works ÛÒ again, I just want to repeat, I'm president, I'm not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. But there's a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws.Û (10/25/10)  ÛÏAmerica is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. Û_ With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, thatÛªs just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed Û_. [W]eÛªve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branchÛªs job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.Û (3/28/11)  ÛÏI can't solve this problem by myself. Û_ [W]e're going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. Û_ I can't do it by myself. We're going to have to change the laws in Congress, but I'm confident we can make it happen.Û (4/20/11)  ÛÏI know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.  But thatÛªs not how democracy works.  See, democracy is hard.  But itÛªs right. Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.Û (4/29/11)  ÛÏSometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But thatÛªs not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what IÛªm committed to doing.Û (5/10/11)  ÛÏI swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books Û_. Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. ThatÛªs not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.Û (7/25/11)  ÛÏSo what weÛªve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books, weÛªve tried to be as fair, humane, just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves need to be changed. Û_ The most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws, weÛªve got to get it through the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by Republicans, and weÛªve got to get 60 votes in the Senate. Û_ Administratively, we can't ignore the law. Û_ I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.  We are doing everything we can administratively.  But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.  And I think thereÛªs been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things.  ItÛªs just not true. Û_ We live in a democracy.  You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.  And if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. We have to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, we can get this thing solved.Û (9/28/11)  In June 2012, President Obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA), allowing ÛÏeligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety Û_ to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.Û He then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own:  ÛÏNow, what IÛªve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, thereÛªs a limit to what I can do. Part of the reason that deportations went up was Congress put a whole lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be higher numbers. What weÛªve said is, letÛªs make sure that youÛªre not misdirecting those resources. But weÛªre still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally. And thatÛªs why this continues to be a top priority of mine. Û_ And we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. But until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, weÛªre going to continue to be bound by the law. Û_ And so part of the challenge as President is constantly saying, Û÷what authorities do I have?ÛªÛ (9/20/12)  ÛÏWe are a nation of immigrants. Û_ But we're also a nation of laws. So what I've said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. And I've done everything that I can on my own[.]Û (10/16/12)  ÛÏI'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law.Û (1/30/13)  ÛÏIÛªm not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.  And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, weÛªve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we canÛªt simply ignore the law. When it comes to the dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, Û÷These folks are generally not a risk. TheyÛªre not involved in crime. Û_ And so letÛªs prioritize our enforcement resources.Ûª But to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do. This is why we need comprehensive immigration reform. To make sure that once and for all, in a way that is, you know, ratified by Congress, we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, whoÛªve put down roots here. Û_ My job is to carry out the law. And so Congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. They give us an order that weÛªve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books.  Û_ If this was an issue that I could do unilaterally I would have done it a long time ago. Û_ The way our system works is Congress has to pass legislation. I then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it.Û (1/30/13)  ÛÏThis is something IÛªve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that IÛªm the president of the United States, IÛªm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic.Û (2/14/13)  ÛÏI think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. Û_ And weÛªve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people Û_. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively.Û (7/16/13)  ÛÏMy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said Û÷here is the lawÛª when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. And, what I have been able to do is to make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress has asked us to do. What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. Û_ But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option. Û_ What I've said is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress.Û (9/17/13)  ÛÏ[I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But weÛªre also a nation of laws. ThatÛªs part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what IÛªm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. Û_ It is not simply a matter of us just saying weÛªre going to violate the law. ThatÛªs not our tradition. The great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out.Û (11/25/13)  ÛÏI am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive immigration reform. But what IÛªve said in the past remains true, which is until Congress passes a new law, then I am constrained in terms of what I am able to do. What IÛªve done is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you canÛªt enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people, there arenÛªt the resources there.  What weÛªve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on people who are engaged in gang activity. Do not focus on young people, who weÛªre calling DREAMers Û_. That already stretched my administrative capacity very far. But I was confident that that was the right thing to do. But at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is, Congress said, Û÷you have to enforce these laws.Ûª They fund the hiring of officials at the department thatÛªs charged with enforcing.  And I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore, you know, any of the other laws that are on the books. ThatÛªs why itÛªs so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year.Û (3/6/14)  ÛÏI think that I never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power].  IÛªm bound by the Constitution; IÛªm bound by separation of powers.  There are some things we canÛªt do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. Û_ Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I donÛªt have a green light. Û_ My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but itÛªs going to be longer-lasting.Û (8/6/14)"

We must always remember the cost in lives and dollars and the lessons that should be learned. It stuns me to remember that 2.5 million people were killed, including over 33,000 Americans. There was no peace agreement; an armistice halted the fighting in 1953, but officially, the Korean Peninsula remains at war. I am reminded that most of us in Congress have never experienced the horrors of combat, yet we give permission to send our young men and women into war more often than we should. Let this anniversary serve as a reminder that we must enter war only as a last resort."

 Created on Thursday, 14 November 2013 00:00. | Written by Patrick Malee. | Print 
 
 by: TIDINGS PHOTO: VERN UYETAKE - U.S. Navy veterans Marlyn Miller and Daniel Larsen spoke to U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader on Veterans Day about their exposure to toxic chemicals while in the service. 
 
 When Daniel Larsen stood up to speak at a mid-October town hall meeting hosted by U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader, it wasnÛªt to voice a complaint about the recent government shutdown or to discuss second amendment rights. 
 
 The issue he brought forward was very specific, one that he and scores of other Navy veterans had dealt with for years, yet remained unknown to officials like Schrader.

4799,"The cost of health insurance premiums for a new customer in the individual market under ObamaCare will go up $151/month on average, and $130/month for those keeping their current plan. According to the White House, we have nothing to worry about since customers will receive a $100 average rebate each year to offset these increased monthly costs. That's right, a $100 rebate to offset an annual increased premium cost of $1812 for new customers and $1560 for existing customers.   The President's fuzzy math means that a lot of families and hardworking Americans are going to have to further tighten their belts to foot the bill for this bad law. This is wrong, which is why in the House we continue to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare with alternatives that will keep costs low, and provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans--something this law fails to do."

Our soldiers are given the best training and resources for the battlefield ÛÒ they deserve the best treatment and care when they return home.

Deporting these children and families isnÛªt a realistic option. We need to focus our limited resources on securing the border and going after drug dealers, gang members and potential terrorists.  ÛÏNew Mexicans have seen firsthand the problems caused by House Republicans, who have dragged their feet on immigration for too long ÛÒ it has been 511 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive reform bill. Because the House wonÛªt act, the president is justified in taking commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system under existing law.   ÛÏThe president is offering a temporary solution to keep families together, give employers who hire workers on visas more certainty about their workforce, and devote our limited resources to deporting dangerous criminals. ItÛªs past time for Congress to work together on a permanent fix of our broken immigration system.Û"

Last year, the FCC spent $2.2 billion of your money on the program, and we have an obligation to make sure that money is being spent wisely.   The fund has increased 266 percent since 2008 and grown almost six-fold since 1998, all while the cost of phone service has gone down. Despite the limit of one subsidized subscriber per household, published reports suggest some subscribers have eight or more phones with subsidized service, with one woman saying that to get one ÛÏshe just goes across the street and gets it.Û One man has claimed to have a bag full of 20 phones on the program that he sells ÛÏfor about 10, 15, 20 bucksÛ each.

4938,"For many hardworking families in the 2nd District, balancing the demands of family and the workplace can be difficult. State and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours, allowing these public-sector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations. However, the federal government prohibits private-sector workers from enjoying this same benefit. 
 
 To remove this obstacle in federal law, the United States House of Representatives will be voting on the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013.  This common-sense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked.  It is pro-family, pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family, attend teacher conferences, care for aging parents, stay home with a newborn, or attend to other family needs that may arise.

4986,"It was a distinct honor to present the Purple Heart to Jeff Fortner, who accepted the medal on behalf of his deceased father James H. Fortner.  James Fortner enlisted in the Army at age 17 in June 1965, and he was later medically retired in 1968 as a direct result of combat.  He served honorably in the 1st Battalion, 32 Infantry and was deployed for 6 months to Korea and 12 months in Vietnam.  In addition to the Purple Heart, Jeff also received on behalf of his father the Good Conduct Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Vietnam Service Medal with 4 bronze service stars; Combat Infantryman Badge 1st Award; Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon with device; Marksman Badge with Machine Gun Bar, Pistol Bar, and Rifle Bar; and Korea Defense Service Medal.

4990,"For the past few weeks, I have been undecided, but leaning against, authorizing military strikes in Syria.  I was willing to remain open until President Obama could make his case to the American people, which he did from the East Room last night.  After listening to the speech, I have not been persuaded to support military action in Syria.  Unfortunately, the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives.  It also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike.  This is consistent with the lack of detail I have received in classified briefings with administration officials.  At the very least, clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before I would consider supporting military action.  I hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation.  But I also realize that a deal brokered by the Russians is unlikely to be, on balance, a very good deal, and will remain difficult to implement.  While we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out, the White House must engage Congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far."

4995,"I applaud Governor PerryÛªs recent decision to deploy the National Guard along our porous southern border. The governor is doing what is best for his state and the people he represents.

4996,"Today, I voted in favor of H.R. 5016 - Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015. The bill stops the IRS from implementing Obamacare, prohibits funds for the IRS to enforce the individual mandate, and prohibits transfers of funds from Health and Human Services to the IRS for Obamacare.   It also prohibits the IRS from targeting individuals based on their political beliefs, cuts funding to the IRS by $341 million dollars, and prohibits funding for the Executive Office of the President to prepare signing statements and Executive Orders that contradict existing law.   This Administration has used the IRS as a weapon against citizens who disagree with him politically and heÛªs used Executive Orders as a weapon against a Congress that disagrees with him legislatively. This bill takes away his ability to do both"
